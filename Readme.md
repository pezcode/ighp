# Global Hotkeys for iTunes

### **NOTICE: This plugin doesn't work with iTunes 12.9 and up anymore.** There's no sensible way to get it to work with the updated visualizer plugin interface so this software is not maintained anymore. Check out [hktunes](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hktunes/) for similar functionality.
